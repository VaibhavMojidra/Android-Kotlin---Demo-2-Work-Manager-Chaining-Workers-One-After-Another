# Android Kotlin Demo 2 Work Manager Chaining Workers One After Another

In a work manager system, chaining workers one after another means executing a series of tasks or workers sequentially, where each worker depends on the completion of the previous worker. This ensures that the workers are executed in a specific order and that the output of one worker is passed as input to the next worker in the chain.
